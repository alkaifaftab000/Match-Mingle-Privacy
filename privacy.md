# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: July 30, 2025**

This privacy policy describes how **[Your App Name]** (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our prototype dating app (“the App”) for demonstration and testing purposes.

## Information We Collect

- **Fake/Generated User Data:** The App uses publicly available APIs to generate fictitious user profiles, including name, age, profession, hometown, and profile images. No real personal data is collected except as needed for app testing.
- **Usage Data:** Basic usage data (such as IP address, browser type, or device information) may be collected by GitHub Pages/hosting provider for analytics and troubleshooting.

## How Information is Used

- User data is used solely to demonstrate core dating app features such as matching, profile display, and swiping for non-commercial, educational, or testing purposes.

## Data Storage

- No real personal data is stored on our servers. All generated profile data is fake and provided by third-party APIs.
- If you contact us (e.g., through GitHub Issues), your contact information is used only to respond to your inquiry.

## Sharing of Information

- We do not sell, trade, or share any user information with third parties.
- Third-party APIs (such as RandomUser.me) may have their own policies. Please review those separately.

## Security

- While the app is a prototype and not intended for production, we take reasonable steps to minimize risks to users and data.

## Children’s Privacy

- The App is for demonstration purposes and not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18.

## Changes to This Policy

- We may update this privacy policy as needed. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised date.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact **[your contact email or GitHub username]**.
